By assigning a cost to carbon emissions, it creates a financial incentive for businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint. This mechanism encourages investment in cleaner technologies, promotes energy efficiency, and supports the transition to renewable energy sources. Additionally, carbon pricing can generate revenue that governments can use to fund sustainable initiatives, public transportation, or social programs, further enhancing the overall impact on sustainability efforts."
